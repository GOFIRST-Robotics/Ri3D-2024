# Ri3D-2024
Official code from UMN Robotics for the 2024 Ri3D/FRC season!
 
 Our subsystems include:
 1) **Drivetrain:**  We chose to use a tank drive this year, and our drivetrain commands include driving a specified distance, turning to a specified angle using a NavX gyroscope, and best of all, autonomously aiming at an Apriltag target and driving within range of it!
 2) **Intake:** _________.
 3) **Launcher:** _________.
 4) **Vision:** We run a Photonvision pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to detect Apriltags, and then we can track and follow either the nearest Apriltag or an Apriltag with a specified ID.
 5) **LED Subsystem:** We also wrote code for controlling RGB LED strips via a REV Blinkin module for some extra bling on our robot!
 
How to get set up for FRC programming:
1) Install the 2024 release of WPILib here: ____________.
2) Install the 2024 NI FRC Game Tools here: ____________.
3) Use this open-source repository as a template for your robot code if you'd like! :)

Our project is created using the "Timed Robot" template/style with our code being written in Java.
